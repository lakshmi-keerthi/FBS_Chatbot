Generate Recurring Income with
Structured notes
FBS specializes in delivering income structured notes, designed to offer high yields with
tailored risk management.
Why Structured notes?
Structured Notes blend traditional securities, like bonds, with advanced financial instruments called derivatives. This combination creates a customized investment that aligns with specific risk and return objectives. Structured Notes can be linked to various underlying assets, such as
stocks, ETFs & indices,
offering tailored exposure to different markets.
Why FBS?
Trusted Sourcing:
We  source structured notes from leading global financial institutions, including JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, and others.
End-to-End Execution & Support:
We handle the entire process—from auctioning notes to setting up and managing accounts—ensuring seamless execution.
Diversification:
Offers an alternative asset class, enhancing portfolio diversification with laddering based on recurring income requirement for clients that’s diversified across institutions and time frame, potentially reducing overall risk.

Why Invest in Private Funds?

Whatsapp community >
Tax Efficiency & Credits –
Many private funds, especially those focused on renewable energy and infrastructure, qualify for federal and state tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and other tax incentives that can significantly reduce taxable income and enhance after-tax returns.
Diversification Beyond Public Markets –
Private funds allow investors to access alternative asset classes such as private equity, private credit, and real assets, reducing portfolio volatility while unlocking opportunities not typically available in public markets.
Enhanced Return Potential –
By investing in niche, high-growth sectors with institutional-quality fund managers, private funds provide opportunities for higher long-term returns than traditional stock and bond investments.
Limited Market Correlation –
Unlike publicly traded securities, private funds often have a lower correlation to market cycles, making them valuable tools for portfolio stability and downside protection.
Renewable Energy & Infrastructure
Expanded tax credits make clean energy one of the most rewarding sectors for investors.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
has significantly expanded
tax incentives for clean energy investments,
making renewable energy
one of the most attractive sectors for tax-conscious investors.
Key provisions include:
🔹 Investment Tax Credit (ITC):
Provides tax credits of up to 30% of the investment cost for qualifying renewable energy projects, including solar, wind, and battery storage.
🔹 Production Tax Credit (PTC):
Offers tax benefits based on the energy output of renewable energy projects, creating potential long-term revenue streams.
🔹 Accelerated Depreciation:
Allows investors to write off substantial portions of their investment upfront, lowering taxable income and maximizing after-tax returns.
By allocating capital to
strategically selected private funds
that leverage these incentives, our clients can optimize their tax position while
supporting the transition to a more sustainable future
.
Opportunity Zone Funds (OZFs)
Invest in Uplifting Communities & pay less in taxes
OZFs offer powerful tax incentives for reinvesting capital gains:
Deferral of capital gains until 2026
Tax-free appreciation if held for 10+ years
Sheltered income through depreciation from real estate projects
OZFs combine social impact with tax-smart investing. Our team identifies quality fund managers and handles all communication to ensure seamless execution.
Delaware Statutory Trusts (DSTs)
Own Institutional Real Estate Without the Headaches
DSTs are ideal for 1031 exchanges, offering:
Full tax deferral on real estate capital gains
Truly passive income from institutional-grade properties
Tax-sheltered cash flow via depreciation
Investors gain real estate exposure without the operational headaches. We help select DSTs aligned with your goals, income needs, and timeline.
Why FBS?
Powered by Strategic Partners
Through our strategic partnership with iCapital, Halo, and other fintech platforms for alternative investments, as well as other top-tier fund managers.
Due Diligence Process
Manager pedigree and track record. Strategy coherence and risk framework. Liquidity terms and fund structure. Legal, operational, and compliance review.

Case Study:
How Dr. Alice Transformed Her Tax Bill into a
$3M Retirement Nest Egg
The Challenge:
High Income, High Taxes, and Limited Savings
Dr. Alice has been maxing out her 401(k) profit-sharing plan, contributing around $77,500 per year (including catch-up contributions). Over the years, she’s built up about $600,000 in retirement savings—not bad, but not nearly enough given her high earnings and plans for financial security.
With five full-time staff members, she values her employees and provides them with safe harbor 401(k) contributions. But she needs a way to turbocharge her savings while reducing her growing tax burden.
The Solution:
A Cash Balance Plan
After consulting with a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) and her CPA, Dr. Alice learns about Cash Balance Plans (CBPs)—a game-changing strategy for high-income professionals like her.
Here’s how her plan is structured:
✔ Dr. Alice contributes $232,000 per year to her CBP
✔ Her staff receives a modest 2–4% pay credit ($3,000–$5,000 per employee)
✔ The plan’s interest credit is set at 5%, ensuring stable growth
✔ Total first-year contribution: $247,000 ($232k for Dr. Alice, ~$15k for staff)
The Immediate Benefits
$77,500 per year in her 401(k), she’s now putting away over $300,000 annually between both plans.
Huge tax savings – With her new $300,000+ contribution, she significantly lowers her taxable income, saving about $100,000 per year in federal and state taxes.
Employee retention – The additional retirement contributions boost staff morale and help her retain top talent.
Fast-Forward 10 Years
By age 60, Dr. Alice’s Cash Balance Plan alone could be worth $2.5–$3 million—on top of her 401(k)!
Her once-modest retirement plan has transformed into a multi-million-dollar safety net, giving her the flexibility to:
✔ Retire comfortably without financial stress
✔ Continue working part-time if she chooses
✔ Leave a lasting financial legacy for her family
Her Only Regret?
Not Doing It Sooner.
Looking back, Dr. Alice wishes she had set up the plan a few years earlier, once her income stabilized. She could have saved even more and reduced her taxes even further.
Her story is a perfect example of how even a small practice with a handful of staff can implement a Cash Balance Plan that heavily benefits the business owner—while staying fully compliant with IRS rules.
Disclaimer: This case study is a hypothetical scenario created for illustrative purposes only. While the income figures, tax implications, and retirement strategies discussed have been evaluated for realistic financial accuracy, Dr. Alice is a fictional character and not an actual client.

Case Study:
How Dr. Emily Carter Supercharged Her Tax-Free Retirement Savings with a
Mega Backdoor Roth
Dr. Emily Carter, a 38-year-old dentist and thriving business owner, has built a reputable practice and enjoys a healthy income of $400,000 per year. Ambitious and financially savvy, she has her sights set on early retirement—but with one major concern nagging at her:
“Am I really taking advantage of all the tax-free options available for retirement?”
She had already been diligently contributing to her 401(k), but felt
frustrated by the IRS contribution limits
and the fact that her income made her ineligible for a Roth IRA. Emily wanted more control over her financial future—and less of it going to taxes.
The Challenge:
High Income, IRS Limits, and Missed Roth Opportunities
Despite her high income and commitment to saving, Dr. Carter was capped at the $23,000 401(k) employee deferral limit (plus employer contributions). As a high earner, she couldn’t contribute to a Roth IRA, and her traditional tax-deferred accounts limited her tax flexibility in retirement.
She needed a legal, strategic way to boost her
tax-free
retirement contributions—without changing her income or business structure.
The Solution:
Mega Backdoor Roth Strategy
After a deep review of her practice’s 401(k) plan, we discovered something powerful: it allowed
after-tax contributions
and
in-service rollovers
—the perfect setup for a
Mega Backdoor Roth
.
Here’s how we restructured her plan:
✔ Dr. Carter continued contributing $23,500 in pre-tax 401(k) deferrals (
plus
$6,5
00 in employer match and profit-sharing
)
✔ We added an
additional $40,000 in after-tax contributions
✔ We rolled those after-tax contributions into a
Roth 401(k)
account via in-service conversion—making all future growth and withdrawals
100% tax-free
The Immediate Benefits
$40,000+ per year of Roth contributions
, completely legal and compliant
Projected lifetime tax savings of over $500,000
Accelerated financial independence
, giving her the flexibility to retire early or scale back at her own pace
No IRS income phase-outs
to worry about—this strategy works regardless of her high income
Fast-Forward 20 Years
By age 58, Dr. Carter’s Roth accounts alone could grow to
over $1.79 million
—all
tax-free
.
This gives her the freedom to: ✔ Retire early without penalty
✔ Access funds tax-free for future medical or living expenses
✔ Reduce taxable RMDs in retirement
✔ Leave behind a powerful legacy for her family
By the time Dr. Carter retires, her Roth account is projected to grow to approximately
$1.79 million
(based on $40,000 annual contributions, 7% growth rate). This will allow her to take
tax-free distributions of around $144,600 per year for 30 years
, giving her a stable, tax-efficient income throughout retirement.
Her Only Regret? Not Starting Sooner.
Like many high earners, Dr. Carter assumed she was “maxing out” her retirement options. Once she saw the potential of the Mega Backdoor Roth strategy, it was a game-changer.
Her story is a powerful reminder
that with the right plan design, even solo or small business owners can unlock
massive
tax-free retirement growth—without needing to change their income or lifestyle.

Why Invest in Private Funds?

Whatsapp community >
Tax Efficiency & Credits –
Many private funds, especially those focused on renewable energy and infrastructure, qualify for federal and state tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and other tax incentives that can significantly reduce taxable income and enhance after-tax returns.
Diversification Beyond Public Markets –
Private funds allow investors to access alternative asset classes such as private equity, private credit, and real assets, reducing portfolio volatility while unlocking opportunities not typically available in public markets.
Enhanced Return Potential –
By investing in niche, high-growth sectors with institutional-quality fund managers, private funds provide opportunities for higher long-term returns than traditional stock and bond investments.
Limited Market Correlation –
Unlike publicly traded securities, private funds often have a lower correlation to market cycles, making them valuable tools for portfolio stability and downside protection.
Renewable Energy & Infrastructure
Expanded tax credits make clean energy one of the most rewarding sectors for investors.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
has significantly expanded
tax incentives for clean energy investments,
making renewable energy

Case Study:
How Dr. Alice Transformed Her Tax Bill into a
$3M Retirement Nest Egg
The Challenge:
High Income, High Taxes, and Limited Savings
Dr. Alice has been maxing out her 401(k) profit-sharing plan, contributing around $77,500 per year (including catch-up contributions). Over the years, she’s built up about $600,000 in retirement savings—not bad, but not nearly enough given her high earnings and plans for financial security.
With five full-time staff members, she values her employees and provides them with safe harbor 401(k) contributions. But she needs a way to turbocharge her savings while reducing her growing tax burden.
The Solution:
A Cash Balance Plan
After consulting with a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) and her CPA, Dr. Alice learns about Cash Balance Plans (CBPs)—a game-changing strategy for high-income professionals like her.
Here’s how her plan is structured:
✔ Dr. Alice contributes $232,000 per year to her CBP
✔ Her staff receives a modest 2–4% pay credit ($3,000–$5,000 per employee)
✔ The plan’s interest credit is set at 5%, ensuring stable growth
✔ Total first-year contribution: $247,000 ($232k for Dr. Alice, ~$15k for staff)
The Immediate Benefits
$77,500 per year in her 401(k), she’s now putting away over $300,000 annually between both plans.
Huge tax savings – With her new $300,000+ contribution, she significantly lowers her taxable income, saving about $100,000 per year in federal and state taxes.
Employee retention – The additional retirement contributions boost staff morale and help her retain top talent.
Fast-Forward 10 Years
By age 60, Dr. Alice’s Cash Balance Plan alone could be worth $2.5–$3 million—on top of her 401(k)!
Her once-modest retirement plan has transformed into a multi-million-dollar safety net, giving her the flexibility to:
✔ Retire comfortably without financial stress
✔ Continue working part-time if she chooses
✔ Leave a lasting financial legacy for her family
Her Only Regret?
Not Doing It Sooner.
Looking back, Dr. Alice wishes she had set up the plan a few years earlier, once her income stabilized. She could have saved even more and reduced her taxes even further.
Her story is a perfect example of how even a small practice with a handful of staff can implement a Cash Balance Plan that heavily benefits the business owner—while staying fully compliant with IRS rules.

Case Study:
How Dr. Emily Carter Supercharged Her Tax-Free Retirement Savings with a
Mega Backdoor Roth
Dr. Emily Carter, a 38-year-old dentist and thriving business owner, has built a reputable practice and enjoys a healthy income of $400,000 per year. Ambitious and financially savvy, she has her sights set on early retirement—but with one major concern nagging at her:
“Am I really taking advantage of all the tax-free options available for retirement?”
She had already been diligently contributing to her 401(k), but felt
frustrated by the IRS contribution limits
and the fact that her income made her ineligible for a Roth IRA. Emily wanted more control over her financial future—and less of it going to taxes.
The Challenge:
High Income, IRS Limits, and Missed Roth Opportunities
Despite her high income and commitment to saving, Dr. Carter was capped at the $23,000 401(k) employee deferral limit (plus employer contributions). As a high earner, she couldn’t contribute to a Roth IRA, and her traditional tax-deferred accounts limited her tax flexibility in retirement.
She needed a legal, strategic way to boost her
tax-free
retirement contributions—without changing her income or business structure.
The Solution:
Mega Backdoor Roth Strategy
After a deep review of her practice’s 401(k) plan, we discovered something powerful: it allowed
after-tax contributions
and
in-service rollovers
—the perfect setup for a
Mega Backdoor Roth
.
Here’s how we restructured her plan:
✔ Dr. Carter continued contributing $23,500 in pre-tax 401(k) deferrals (
plus
$6,5
00 in employer match and profit-sharing
)
✔ We added an
additional $40,000 in after-tax contributions
✔ We rolled those after-tax contributions into a
Roth 401(k)
account via in-service conversion—making all future growth and withdrawals
100% tax-free
The Immediate Benefits
$40,000+ per year of Roth contributions
, completely legal and compliant
Projected lifetime tax savings of over $500,000
Accelerated financial independence
, giving her the flexibility to retire early or scale back at her own pace
No IRS income phase-outs
to worry about—this strategy works regardless of her high income
Fast-Forward 20 Years
By age 58, Dr. Carter’s Roth accounts alone could grow to
over $1.79 million
—all
tax-free
.
This gives her the freedom to: ✔ Retire early without penalty
✔ Access funds tax-free for future medical or living expenses
✔ Reduce taxable RMDs in retirement
✔ Leave behind a powerful legacy for her family
By the time Dr. Carter retires, her Roth account is projected to grow to approximately
$1.79 million
(based on $40,000 annual contributions, 7% growth rate). This will allow her to take
tax-free distributions of around $144,600 per year for 30 years
, giving her a stable, tax-efficient income throughout retirement.
Her Only Regret? Not Starting Sooner.
Like many high earners, Dr. Carter assumed she was “maxing out” her retirement options. Once she saw the potential of the Mega Backdoor Roth strategy, it was a game-changer.
Her story is a powerful reminder
that with the right plan design, even solo or small business owners can unlock
massive
tax-free retirement growth—without needing to change their income or lifestyle.
